Caching!

Finally learning about what caching is! This includes caching systems and cache eviction strategies, such as LIFO, FIFO, LFU, LRU, MRU.

The purpose of a cache is to help applications run smoother or more quickly by accessing data that has already been stored so that potentially time-consuming/memory-consuming queries don't have to run from the source code every time, but can instead use data stored temporarily in the cache (often in-memory storage).
