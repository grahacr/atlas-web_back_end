Getting back into asyncio with async/await function practice!
Asynchronous programming - coroutines save time because of less overhead, great for I/O operations such as web requests or database queries. 
Important terms to know:
- coroutines
- event loop
- async
- await
- asyncio 

Asynch programming/coroutines is in contrast to synchronous programming/threads. can be resource-intensive, but great for independent tasks that can be executed in parallel.
